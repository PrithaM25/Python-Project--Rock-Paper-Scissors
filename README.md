**Title: Rock, Paper, Scissors Game**

**Objective:**
The Rock, Paper, Scissors Game is a classic and entertaining project designed to simulate the popular hand game. Players can compete against the computer in a series of rounds, with the goal 
of outwitting their opponent by selecting the winning hand gesture.

**Features:**

**. User Input:** The game prompts the player to choose their hand gesture from three options: Rock, Paper, or Scissors. Players input their choice through the command line or graphical user 
interface (GUI) depending on the implementation.

**. Computer Selection:** After the player makes their choice, the computer randomly selects one of the three hand gestures as its move. This ensures unpredictability and adds an element of 
challenge to the game.

**. Comparison:** The player's chosen gesture and the computer's selection are compared to determine the winner of the round. The game follows the traditional rules: Rock crushes Scissors, Scissors 
cuts Paper, and Paper covers Rock.

**. Outcome Display:** The game displays the result of each round, indicating whether the player won, lost, or tied with the computer. Additionally, the game updates the score to reflect the number of
wins, losses, and ties accumulated throughout the game.

**. Multiple Rounds:** The game consists of multiple rounds, allowing players to compete against the computer in a series of matches. The number of rounds can be predefined or determined dynamically
based on user input.

**. Endgame Condition:** The game concludes when a predetermined number of rounds have been played or when the player decides to quit. At the end of the game, the final score is displayed, along with 
a message declaring the overall winner.


**Implementation:**

The Rock, Paper, Scissors Game can be implemented using Python's core functionalities, including random number generation, user input/output operations, and conditional statements. 
Here's a high-level overview of the implementation steps:

1) Define the three hand gestures: Rock, Paper, and Scissors.
2) Implement a function to prompt the player for their choice and validate the input.
3) Generate a random selection for the computer's move using Python's random module.
4) Compare the player's choice and the computer's selection to determine the outcome of each round.
5) Update the score based on the result of each round.
6) Repeat steps 2-5 for the desired number of rounds.
7) Display the final score and declare the overall winner of the game.
8) Provide an option for the player to play again or exit the game.

By following these steps and leveraging Python's simplicity and versatility, you can create an engaging Rock, Paper, Scissors Game that provides hours of entertainment for players of all
ages.
